# Audio-to-Gesture-A-Real-Time-Spoken-Language-to-Sign-Language-Translation-System
This project introduces an offline voice-to-sign language translation system that bridges the communication gap between hearing individuals and those who are deaf or hard of hearing. 
It converts spoken English into Indian Sign Language (ISL) or American Sign Language (ASL) by leveraging the Vosk speech recognition toolkit to transcribe speech into text, which is then processed with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and lemmatization using WordNet. 
The processed words are mapped to corresponding sign language video clips stored locally, while out-of-vocabulary terms (such as names) are spelled out using sign alphabet images. 
The system generates a real-time video output for seamless communication and remains fully functional without internet connectivity, ensuring accessibility in low-connectivity environments. 
Built with Python, pre-recorded ISL/ASL video assets, and sign alphabets, this solution promotes inclusivity and accessibility across various domains such as education, healthcare, workplaces, and public services.
